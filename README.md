# sage-2.2.0
Next minor version of the Sage force field. **In development, do not use**

## Changes from Sage 2.1.0
All of these changes are a result of the [torsion multiplicity][tm] work
attempting to separate proper torsion parameters such that they apply only to
central bonds with a single multiplicity:
- t73 split into t73 and t73a
- t74 split into t74 and t74a
- t82 split into t82 and t82ax
- t83 split into t83 and t83ax
- t116 split into t116, t116a, t116b, and t116c
- t118 split into t118 and t118a
- t121 split into t121 and t121a
- t122 split into t122a, b, c, d, e, and f
- t130 split into t130a, b, c, and d
- t132 split into t132a, b, c, and d
- t133 split into t133 and t133a
- t142 split into t142a, b, c, d, e, and f
- t143 split into t143a, b, c, d, e, and f
- t157 split into t157 and t157a
